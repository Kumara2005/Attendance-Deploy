# This file configures Git to handle line endings properly
# across Windows, Mac, and Linux environments

# Prevent "everything changed" issues due to line endings
[core]
    # Windows: Convert LF to CRLF on checkout, CRLF to LF on commit
    # Mac/Linux: Keep LF as-is
    autocrlf = true
    
    # Warn if mixed line endings are detected
    safecrlf = warn
    
    # Use UTF-8 encoding
    quotepath = false

# Line ending configuration for specific file types
[diff]
    # Use better diff algorithm
    algorithm = patience
    
[merge]
    # Use better merge strategy
    conflictstyle = diff3
